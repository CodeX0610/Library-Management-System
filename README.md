# Library Management System

## Overview

This is a simple yet comprehensive Library Management System designed to automate the operations of a library. It allows administrators to manage books, users, and transactions (borrowing/returning books), while users can search for books and check their borrowing history. The system aims to streamline library workflows, reduce manual errors, and improve efficiency.

This project is ideal for educational purposes, small libraries, or as a starting point for more advanced library software.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register new users, update profiles, and manage user roles (e.g., admin, librarian, member).
- **Book Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search for books by title, author, ISBN, or category.
- **Borrowing and Returning**: Track book loans, due dates, fines for overdue books, and availability status.
- **Search Functionality**: Advanced search for books with filters.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on borrowed books, overdue items, and inventory status.
- **Authentication**: Secure login system for admins and users.
- **Database Integration**: Stores data persistently (e.g., using SQLite/MySQL).

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.12
- **Framework/Libraries**: [Specify if applicable, e.g., Tkinter for GUI, Flask/Django for web, or libraries like SQLAlchemy for database handling].
- **Database**: [e.g., SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL] (update based on your project).
- **Other Tools**: Git for version control, and any additional libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
- pip (comes bundled with Python).
- Optional: A virtual environment tool like `venv` for isolated dependencies.
- A database server if applicable (e.g., install MySQL and create a database).

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/CodeX0610/Library-Management-System.git
cd Library-Management-System

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set up the database:
- Run the provided SQL script: `database/setup.sql` to initialize tables (if your project includes this).
- Update configuration files (e.g., `config.py`) with your database credentials.

5. Run the application:
python main.py # Or the entry point file, e.g., python app.py for a web app
- If it's a web app (e.g., using Flask), you might need: `flask run` or `python app.py`.

## Usage

1. **Admin Login**: Use default credentials (e.g., username: admin, password: admin123) to access the admin dashboard.
2. **Adding a Book**: Navigate to the "Books" section, fill in details, and save.
3. **Borrowing a Book**: Search for a book, check availability, and issue it to a user.
4. **Generating Reports**: Go to the "Reports" tab and select the desired report type.
